# Claude Code Installation Guide for Ubuntu

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring Claude Code on Ubuntu systems.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Claude Code, ensure you have Node.js version 18 or greater installed on your system.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Check System Requirements

First, verify that Node.js and npm are installed and meet the version requirements:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18 or greater)
node -v

# Check npm version
npm -v
```

If Node.js is not installed or the version is below 18, install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### 2. Install Claude Code Globally

Install Claude Code using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Important:** Avoid using `sudo` with this command as it can cause permission issues.

### 3. Verify Installation

Check if Claude Code was installed successfully:

```bash
npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This should show the installed version (e.g., `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.0.25`).

### 4. Fix PATH Issues (Common Problem)

If you get "claude: command not found" error, the npm global bin directory is not in your PATH. Here's how to fix it:

#### Check npm global prefix:
```bash
npm config get prefix
```

#### Find the claude binary:
```bash
# Replace the path below with your npm prefix from the previous command
ls -la /tmp/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/claude
```

#### Create a permanent symbolic link:
```bash
# Create a symlink in a directory that's already in PATH
sudo ln -sf /tmp/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/claude /usr/local/bin/claude
```

**Note:** Replace `/tmp/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/claude` with the actual path from your npm prefix.

### 5. Verify Claude Code Works

Test that Claude Code is now accessible:

```bash
# Check version
claude --version

# View help
claude --help
```

You should see output like:
```
1.0.25 (Claude Code)
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables (Optional)

For automated workflows or to skip confirmations, you can set these environment variables:

```bash
# Skip confirmation prompts
export CLAUDE_SKIP_CONFIRMATIONS=true

# Auto-approve actions
export CLAUDE_AUTO_APPROVE=true

# Enable auto-execution
export ANTHROPIC_AUTO_EXECUTE=true
```

Add these to your shell profile for permanent use:
```bash
echo 'export CLAUDE_SKIP_CONFIRMATIONS=true' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export CLAUDE_AUTO_APPROVE=true' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_AUTO_EXECUTE=true' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start interactive session
claude

# Non-interactive mode (print and exit)
claude --print "Your prompt here"

# Continue previous conversation
claude --continue

# Resume a specific conversation
claude --resume

# View configuration options
claude config

# Check system health
claude doctor
```

### Authentication

When you first run Claude Code, you'll need to authenticate:

1. **Run the `claude` command:**
   - Open your terminal and simply type `claude`
   - This will start the interactive authentication process.

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions:**
   - Claude Code will guide you through the authentication process.
   - This typically involves connecting through the Anthropic Console.

3. **Complete the OAuth process:**
   - You'll be redirected to a web browser to complete the OAuth flow.
   - Follow the prompts to authorize Claude Code to access your Anthropic account.

4. **Ensure you have a Claude Pro or Max plan:**
   - You may need a Claude Pro or Max subscription for unified access.
   - Check your Anthropic account to confirm your subscription status.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found Error

If you still get "claude: command not found" after installation:

1. **Check if the binary exists:**
   ```bash
   find /tmp -name "claude" -type f 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Verify the symbolic link:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /usr/local/bin/claude
   ```

3. **Check your PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH | grep -o "/usr/local/bin"
   ```

### Permission Issues

This is a common issue when installing global npm packages on Linux-based systems, including WSL. The problem is:

```bash
npm ERR! Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'
```

This means npm is trying to install global packages to a system-wide location that requires root privileges, but you ran the command as a normal user.

#### ✅ Quick Fix: Run with sudo
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This is the most straightforward and clean solution if you're installing global tools like CLI programs.

#### ✅ Safer Alternative: Use nvm (Node Version Manager)

If you don't want to use sudo, or you plan to install/manage multiple Node versions:

1. **Install nvm (if not already):**
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Install latest Node.js LTS:**
   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts
   ```

3. **Reinstall the CLI tool globally (now under user-owned directory):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

This installs everything into `~/.nvm` so there's no need for root.

#### ✅ Alternative: Fix npm permissions manually

If you prefer to fix npm permissions without using nvm:

1. **Don't use sudo with npm install**
2. **Fix npm permissions:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.npm-global
   npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
   echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Alternative PATH Method

If the symbolic link approach doesn't work, you can add the npm bin directory to your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="/tmp/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Authentication Issues

If you get "Invalid API key · Please run /login":

1. **Run the `claude` command:**
   - Open your terminal and simply type `claude`
   - This will start the interactive authentication process.

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions:**
   - Claude Code will guide you through the authentication process.
   - This typically involves connecting through the Anthropic Console.

3. **Complete the OAuth process:**
   - You'll be redirected to a web browser to complete the OAuth flow.
   - Follow the prompts to authorize Claude Code to access your Anthropic account.

4. **Ensure you have a Claude Pro or Max plan:**
   - You may need a Claude Pro or Max subscription for unified access.
   - Check your Anthropic account to confirm your subscription status.
