# Claude Code Autonomous Configuration

This document outlines the steps executed to configure Claude Code for autonomous operation, reducing permission prompts.

## Steps Executed Successfully

### 1. Located Configuration Directory
- Searched for existing Claude Code settings file using `find` command
- Checked common configuration locations (`~/.config/claude-code/`, `~/.claude-code/`)
- Created configuration directory at `~/.config/claude-code/`

### 2. Created Settings Configuration
Created `settings.json` file at `/root/.config/claude-code/settings.json` with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "acceptEdits",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(*)", "Edit", "Write", "Read", "Glob", "Grep", "LS", "MultiEdit", "Task"],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

## Configuration Details

- **defaultMode**: Set to `"acceptEdits"` to automatically accept file edits without prompting
- **permissions.allow**: Configured to allow all common tools without permission requests:
  - `Bash(*)` - All bash commands
  - `Edit` - File editing operations
  - `Write` - File writing operations
  - `Read` - File reading operations
  - `Glob` - File pattern matching
  - `Grep` - Text search operations
  - `LS` - Directory listing
  - `MultiEdit` - Multiple file edits
  - `Task` - Task management operations

## Usage

After configuration, restart Claude Code for the settings to take effect. Claude will now operate more autonomously with fewer permission prompts.

## Commands Used

```bash
# Search for existing settings
find $HOME -name "settings.json" -path "*claude*" 2>/dev/null

# Check configuration directories
ls -la $HOME/.config/claude-code/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la $HOME/.claude-code/ 2>/dev/null

# Create configuration directory
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/claude-code

# Settings file created with Write tool
# /root/.config/claude-code/settings.json
```
