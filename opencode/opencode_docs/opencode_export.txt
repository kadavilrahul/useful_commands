Exporting Chat History from opencode
=====================================

opencode provides several ways to save and share your conversations.

/share Command - Create Shareable Links
----------------------------------------
The primary way to export conversations is using the /share command:

Usage:
  /share

What it does:
- Creates a shareable web link to the current conversation
- Automatically copies the link to your clipboard
- The link can be accessed by anyone you share it with
- Example link format: https://opencode.ai/s/4XP1fce5

Note: Conversations are not shared by default - you must explicitly use /share

/export Command - Export to Editor
-----------------------------------
Once you have configured an editor (see opencode_editor.txt), you can use:

Usage:
  /export

What it does:
- Opens your configured editor with the chat history
- Allows you to save the conversation locally in any format
- Useful for creating documentation or keeping offline records

Prerequisites:
1. Set up your EDITOR environment variable (see opencode_editor.txt)
2. Example: export EDITOR="code --wait" for VS Code

Storage Location
----------------
Chat history is stored internally at:
~/.local/share/opencode/storage/

Structure:
- session/   - Session metadata (ID, title, timestamps)
- message/   - Message metadata (role, timestamps)
- part/      - Actual message text content

Note: These are internal JSON files not designed for manual export

Other Export Methods
--------------------
1. Terminal Copy/Paste:
   - Select and copy text directly from your terminal
   - Works if your terminal supports scrollback

2. Terminal Logging:
   - Start opencode with output redirection:
     opencode | tee conversation.log
   - Or use terminal recording tools like script or asciinema

3. Manual JSON Export (Advanced):
   - Navigate to ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/
   - Parse JSON files in session/, message/, and part/ directories
   - Requires scripting to reconstruct conversations

Configuration Options
---------------------
In your opencode.json config file, you can set sharing preferences:

{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "share": "manual"  // Options: "manual", "auto", "disabled"
}

- "manual": Allow manual sharing via /share command (default)
- "auto": Automatically share new conversations
- "disabled": Disable sharing entirely

Best Practices
--------------
1. Use /share for quick sharing with team members
2. Use /export to save important conversations locally
3. Consider privacy before sharing conversations with sensitive information
4. Keep exported conversations organized by project or date

Limitations
-----------
- No built-in batch export for multiple conversations
- Shared links require internet access to view
- Internal storage format may change between versions
