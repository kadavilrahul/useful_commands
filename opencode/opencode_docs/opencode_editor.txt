Setting Up Editor for opencode
================================

The /editor command in opencode allows you to open an external text editor from within the opencode interface.

How to Configure
-----------------
Set the EDITOR environment variable to your preferred text editor.

Temporary Setup (Current Session Only)
---------------------------------------
export EDITOR="your-editor-here"
opencode

Permanent Setup
---------------
Add the export command to your shell configuration file:

For Bash (~/.bashrc):
  echo 'export EDITOR="your-editor-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

For Zsh (~/.zshrc):
  echo 'export EDITOR="your-editor-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc

For Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish):
  echo 'set -x EDITOR "your-editor-here"' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
  source ~/.config/fish/config.fish

Common Editor Values
--------------------
Terminal Editors:
  export EDITOR="vim"           # Vim
  export EDITOR="nvim"          # Neovim
  export EDITOR="nano"          # Nano
  export EDITOR="emacs -nw"     # Emacs in terminal
  export EDITOR="hx"            # Helix
  export EDITOR="micro"         # Micro

GUI Editors (requires --wait flag):
  export EDITOR="code --wait"          # VS Code
  export EDITOR="subl --wait"          # Sublime Text
  export EDITOR="atom --wait"          # Atom
  export EDITOR="gedit --wait"         # Gedit
  export EDITOR="notepad++ -multiInst" # Notepad++ (Windows)

Important Notes
---------------
1. GUI editors need the --wait flag to make the terminal wait until you close the editor
2. The editor command must be in your system PATH
3. After setting EDITOR, restart opencode or start a new terminal session
4. Test with: echo $EDITOR to verify the setting

Using the /editor Command
-------------------------
Once configured, in opencode you can:
1. Type /editor to open your configured editor
2. Make your changes in the editor
3. Save and close the editor
4. The content will be inserted into your opencode prompt

Troubleshooting
---------------
- "No EDITOR set" error: The EDITOR variable is not configured
- Editor doesn't open: Check if the editor command is installed and in PATH
- Editor opens but doesn't wait: Add the --wait flag for GUI editors
- Changes don't appear in opencode: Make sure to save before closing the editor

Example: Setting VS Code as Default
------------------------------------
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export EDITOR="code --wait"

# Apply changes:
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc

# Test:
echo $EDITOR  # Should output: code --wait
